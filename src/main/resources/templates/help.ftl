                This depends on whether or not the Play Treasure Cards option is enabled for your game.
                <br>
                <br>
                This option will always be enabled if the game includes cards that may depend on the order treasure cards are played.
                <br>
                <br>
                If playing treasure cards is required then there will be a "Play Treasure Cards" link above the cards in your hand when it is your turn.
                <br>
                Clicking this link will play all of the treasure cards that do not depend on the order they are played in.
                <br>
                All treasure cards can be played by clicking the card you want to play.
                <br>
                <br>
                If this option is not enabled then you do not play treasure cards. When you are ready to buy a card you just click the card you want to buy.
