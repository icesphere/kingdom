*** stuff to do ***

show recent usernames on login page
don't require password for login
require password for admin page

*** stuff to maybe do ***

show recent events
admin cancel current game is broken
cards overflow weird when too many on desktop (use flexbox?)

better bots
fix add specific type of card from confirm cards page

support multiple info messages?
refresh sometimes has issues after quit game
considering using embedded database so app can be deployed easily anywhere
consider using web storage for database
still need better refresh
remove all jquery ui dialogs
better logic for choosing cards for bots - e.g. chose card for Masquerade
consolidate select card actions
