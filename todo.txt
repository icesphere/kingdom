repeat game is broken
cards overflow weird when too many on desktop
bots need to be better
support multiple info messages
refresh sometimes has issues after quit game
problem starting new game after exiting game
info dialogs look weird - change how to show info dialogs
maybe show card name of card that triggered card action and maybe show who played the card if not you
considering using embedded database so app can be deployed easily anywhere
fix play all treasure cards
figure out how to show what previous player(s) bought
merchant is broken
