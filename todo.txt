repeat game is broken
throne room should wait for all of card to be resolved before continuing to next play of card
cards overflow weird when too many on desktop
bots need to be better
refresh sometimes has issues after quit game
problem starting new game after exiting game
info dialogs look weird
better notification of chat on mobile view
maybe show card name of card that triggered card action and maybe show who played the card if not you
considering using embedded database so app can be deployed easily anywhere
fix play all treasure cards
refresh issues
