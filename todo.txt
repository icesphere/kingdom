handle throne room a throne room which then copies a duration card
cancel a created game that hasn't started yet has issues
cards overflow weird when too many on desktop (use flexbox?)

better logic for choosing cards for bots - e.g. chose card for Masquerade
consolidate select card actions

remind player which tavern cards are available to use at start of turn
consolidate choose supply card to gain methods
show all cards gained - not just cards bought in the cards bought section of the page
move custom card selection above events on create game page
smoother transition from bot turn to human turn
add cookie to remember admin user
bot logic for Lurker
bot logic for Peddler
bot logic for empty piles
let someone know when they haven't ended their turn
maybe instead of showing cards bought for other players, hide that section and show info message anytime they gain a card?
bot sometimes freezes on buy phase
royal seal shouldn't ask multiple times if answer is no
Encampment got 11 cards - probably from bot
refresh on lobby page should not clear out chats
bot should not buy too many village type cards
2 Amulets - order of actions - should wait for first one to complete
bot - don't buy curse cards if curses low
bot logic for events
auto end turn after action if no buys
probably don't need isShowCoffers var in Game
weird ending of turn after Crown + Survivors
Overlord -> Legionary -> reveal Gold didn't wait for players
