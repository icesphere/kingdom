repeat game is broken
cards overflow weird when too many on desktop (use flexbox?)
better bots
support multiple info messages?
refresh sometimes has issues after quit game
considering using embedded database so app can be deployed easily anywhere
show turn summaries
still need better refresh
remove all jquery ui dialogs
better logic for choosing cards for bots - e.g. chose card for Masquerade
consolidate select card actions
fix add specific type of card from confirm cards page
allow adding cards not in supply from modify hand page
