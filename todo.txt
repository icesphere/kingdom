separate out logs into events and info and just show events in recent events in history
admin cancel current game is broken if admin is user in game
cards overflow weird when too many on desktop (use flexbox?)

fix or remove code for add specific type of card from confirm cards page

figure out why create game page takes a long time to load the bottom of the page

better bots
support multiple info messages?
refresh sometimes has issues after quit game
considering using embedded database so app can be deployed easily anywhere
consider using web storage for database
still need better refresh
remove all jquery ui dialogs
better logic for choosing cards for bots - e.g. chose card for Masquerade
consolidate select card actions
