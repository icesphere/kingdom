cards overflow weird when too many on desktop (use flexbox?)

fix or remove code for add specific type of card from confirm cards page

figure out why create game page takes a long time to load the bottom of the page

better bots
refresh sometimes has issues after quit game
remove all jquery ui dialogs
better logic for choosing cards for bots - e.g. chose card for Masquerade
consolidate select card actions
